## 🧩 Overview

Machine Trust Protocol (MTP) establishes a **verifiable trust layer for the machine economy**, allowing devices, agents, and AI systems to:
- Prove **who** they are (*ProofX*)
- Prove **what** they executed (*PoRW*)
- Settle **how** value is transferred (*MTP-Settlement*)

It bridges Web2, Web3, and AI compute environments under one interoperable, decentralized trust fabric.

## 🧠 Vision

MTP transforms **trust into a computational primitive** — verifiable, measurable, and programmable.  
By linking identity, execution, and settlement through cryptographic proofs, MTP enables a future where **machines can act, pay, and be trusted** — autonomously.
